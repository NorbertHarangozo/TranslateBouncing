# TranslateBouncing

This application is using IBM's Watson cloud service to translate text from a given language to random languages a set amount
of times, and then translates it back to the original language. The API seems to have some limitations when it comes to translating
from one language to another. For this reason, we're translating the text to English (in case it's not in English already).

This project serves as my assignment for the Multiparadigm programming languages class in Eszterházy Károly University.
It isn't quite finished, the time I could spend on it was extremely limited.

To get started, clone the repo and open it in your favorite IDE.  
**Rename configuration-example.json to configuration.json**.  
**Make sure to enter your apikey and serviceUrl**, if you don't recall having any of these things, you sign up for free [here](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/language-translator/).
